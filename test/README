You need to install "perl-Test-Harness", available thru yum/dnf, in order to run these tests.   
That's a very standard package, you shouldn't have to go far to find a package.
If you're using CPAN, I think it's spelled "Test::Harness". 

To run the tests: 
a) You can use ./allTests.pl to run all the tests, in order
b) You can run each test individually, but they assume they are run from the test/ directory, 
   so run them as: 
[nmacgreg@its004nm2 test]$ t/001basic.t 
	ok 1 - script should return a zero, where there are no problems
	1..1

(Don't "cd test/t; ./001basic.t", because they're not designed to run that way)
